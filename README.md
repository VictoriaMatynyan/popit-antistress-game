### Review
**Pop it** is a famous simple game that helps to kill one's time when needed. Realized with HTML5, CSS3 and a bit of JavaScript.
One can use it while waiting in line, taking a bus, going to subway and so on.

### Applied decisions:
* HTML5 and CSS3;
* pseudo-classes for CSS selectors;
* CSS animation;
* keyframes;
* hovering elements;
* media queries;  
* adaptive web-design has been realized up to 320px.

### Please, enjoy!
